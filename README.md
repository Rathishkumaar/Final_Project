Supply Chain Analysis in Python
We will perform the following steps to analyze the dataset:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and correct data types.
Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics for key metrics.
Visualization: Create visualizations to understand trends and patterns.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.
1. Data Cleaning
Let's start by checking for missing values and correcting data types.

2. Descriptive Statistics
Generate summary statistics for key metrics such as Price, Revenue generated, Stock levels, Lead times, etc.

3. Visualization
Create visualizations to understand trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we can derive insights and recommendations. For example:

Pricing Strategy: Identify optimal pricing points for different product types to maximize revenue.
Stock Management: Adjust stock levels based on sales performance and lead times to reduce holding costs.
Vendor Performance: Evaluate vendor performance based on lead times and defect rates to improve procurement efficiency.

Summary of Supply Chain Analysis
Data Cleaning
The data was checked for missing values, and the necessary columns were converted to the appropriate data types. The dataset was then cleaned by dropping rows with significant missing values. The cleaned data shows no missing values and has the correct data types for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics
Here are the summary statistics for key metrics in the dataset:

Price: Mean - 49.46, Std Dev - 31.17
Availability: Mean - 48.4, Std Dev - 30.74
Number of products sold: Mean - 460.99, Std Dev - 303.78
Revenue generated: Mean - 5776.05, Std Dev - 2732.84
Stock levels: Mean - 47.77, Std Dev - 31.37
Lead times: Mean - 15.96, Std Dev - 8.79

Visualizations
Distribution of Product Prices:

Most products are priced between $20 and $80.
There is a significant spread in product prices, with a few outliers on the higher end.
Revenue Generated by Product Type:

The revenue generated varies significantly across different product types.
Some product types consistently generate higher revenue.
Stock Levels by Location:

Stock levels are unevenly distributed across different locations.
Some locations maintain significantly higher stock levels compared to others.
Lead Times by Product Type:

Lead times vary across product types, with some products having consistently longer lead times.
Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, here are some actionable insights and recommendations:

Pricing Strategy: Identify optimal pricing points for different product types to maximize revenue. Consider running A/B tests to determine the impact of price changes on sales.
Stock Management: Adjust stock levels based on sales performance and lead times to reduce holding costs and avoid stockouts. Implement an inventory optimization model.
Vendor Performance: Evaluate vendor performance based on lead times and defect rates to improve procurement efficiency. Consider renegotiating contracts with underperforming vendors.
Demand Forecasting: Use historical sales data to forecast demand and adjust procurement plans accordingly. This can help in maintaining optimal stock levels and reducing excess inventory.
Operational Efficiency: Analyze the efficiency of different locations in terms of stock turnover and sales performance. Optimize logistics and transportation routes to reduce costs and improve delivery times.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of your supply chain data and highlights areas for potential improvement and optimization.
